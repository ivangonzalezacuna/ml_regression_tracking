# Logistic Regression Library

Library used to make a Logistic Regression model based in some CSV data. The best model is obtained based in a loop, which will select the model with the higher Accuracy parameter.

With the function to make a prediction, the library will return a 0 (no presence detected) or 1 (presence detected), which will be handled by the main process.
